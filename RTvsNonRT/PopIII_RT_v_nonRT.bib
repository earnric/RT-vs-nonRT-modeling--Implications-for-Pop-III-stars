@article{Teyssier2001,
	abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 97), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated to shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density LCDM universe are finally reported, with 256{\^{}}3 particles and 4.1 10{\^{}}7 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192{\^{}}3. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloes temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

@article{Rosdahl2013,
	abstract = {We present a new implementation of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code RAMSES. The multi-group radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure for the Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via non-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-based approach has the large advantage that the computational cost is independent of the number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of emission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into RAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection solver for the radiative transport, the time step is restricted by the speed of light - a severe limitation that can be alleviated using the so--called "reduced speed of light" approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity of this approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxy formation. We finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite of RHD tests, comparing our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that our code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect of radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We make use of new subgrid model of turbulent mixing to accurately follow the cosmological evolution of the first stars, the mixing of their supernova ejecta, and the impact on the chemical composition of the Galactic Halo. Using the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, we implement a model for the pollution of pristine gas as described in Pan et al. Tracking the metallicity of Pop III stars with metallicities below a critical value allows us to account for the fraction of Z {\textless} Zcrit stars formed even in regions in which the gas' average metallicity is well above Zcrit. We demonstrate that such partially-mixed regions account for 0.5 to 0.7 of all Pop III stars formed up to z = 5. Additionally, we track the creation and transport of "primordial metals" (PM) generated by Pop III supernovae (SNe). These neutron-capture deficient metals are taken up by second-generation stars and likely lead to unique abundance signatures characteristic of carbon-enhanced, metal-poor (CEMP-no) stars. As an illustrative example, we associate primordial metals with abundance ratios used by Keller et al. to explain the source of metals in the star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, finding good agreement with the observed [Fe/H], [C/H], [O/H], and [Mg/Ca] ratios in CEMP-no Milky Way halo stars. Similar future simulations will aid in further constraining the properties of Pop III stars using CEMP observations, as well as improve predictions of the spatial distribution of Pop III stars, as will be explored by the next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes.},

	abstract = {Direct observational searches for Population III (Pop III) stars at high-redshift are faced with the question of how to select the most promising targets for spectroscopic follow up. To help answer this, we use a large-scale cosmological simulation, augmented with a new subgrid model that tracks the fraction of pristine gas, to follow the evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the Pop III stars they contain. We generate rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions for our galaxies and find that they are consistent with current {\$}z \backslashge 7 {\$} observations. Throughout the redshift range {\$}7 \backslashle z \backslashle 16{\$} we identify 'Pop III-bright' galaxies as those with at least 75{\%} of their flux coming from Pop III stars. While less than 5{\%} of galaxies brighter than {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV, AB{\}} = 31.4{\$} mag are Pop III-bright between {\$}7\backslashleq z \backslashleq8{\$}, roughly a third of such galaxies are Pop III-bright at {\$}z=9{\$}, right before reionization occurs in our simulation. Moving to {\$}z=10{\$}, {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV, AB{\}} = 31.4{\$} mag corresponds to more luminous galaxies and the Pop III-bright fraction falls off to 15{\%}. Finally at the highest redshifts, a large fraction of all galaxies are Pop III-bright regardless of magnitude. While {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV, AB{\}} = 31.4{\$} mag galaxies are likely not detectable during this epoch, we find 90{\%} of galaxies at {\$}z = 16{\$} are Pop III-bright with {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV, AB{\}} \backslashle 33{\$} mag, a lensed magnitude limit within reach of the James Webb Space Telescope. Thus we predict that the best redshift to search for luminous Pop III-bright galaxies is just before reionization, while lensing surveys for fainter galaxies should push to the highest redshifts possible.},

	abstract = {We study the observational consequences of several unknown properties of Population III (Pop III) stars using large-scale cosmological simulations that include a subgrid model to track the unresolved mixing of pollutants. Varying the value of the critical metallicity that marks the boundary between Pop III and Population II (Pop II) star formation across 2 dex has a negligible effect on the fraction of Pop III stars formed and the subsequent fraction of Pop III flux from high-redshift galaxies. However, adopting a log normal initial mass function (IMF) for Pop III stars, in place of a baseline Salpeter IMF, results in a Pop III star formation rate density (SFRD) that is 1/4 of the baseline rate. The flux from high-redshift galaxies modeled with this IMF is highly bimodal, resulting in a tiny fraction of {\$}z \backslashleq 8{\$} galaxies with more than 75$\backslash${\%} of their flux coming from Pop III stars. However, at {\$}z=9{\$}, right before reionization in our simulations, {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 20$\backslash${\%} of galaxies are Pop III-bright with {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV{\}} \backslashle 31.4{\$} mag and at least 75$\backslash${\%} of their flux generated by Pop III stars . Additionally, the log normal Pop III IMF results in a population of carbon enhanced, metal poor stars in reasonable agreement with MW halo observations. Our analysis supports the conclusion that the Pop III IMF was dominated by stars in the 20-120{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} range that generate SN with carbon-enhanced ejecta.},
